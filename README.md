# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical factors using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project comes from the heart.csv file, and the implementation is done in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

Project Overview
This project uses a dataset containing medical data to predict whether a patient has heart disease. The notebook walks through the process of loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model to make predictions.

Key Features:
Data exploration and visualization
Feature engineering
Model training (classification algorithms)
Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have the dataset heart.csv in the working directory.
Open the Jupyter notebook Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb.
Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results or modify them as per your requirements.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a public dataset (heart.csv), which contains the following columns:

Age: The age of the patient
Sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
CP: Chest pain type (categorical variable)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
... [other medical features]
Model Training
The following models are used in this project:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The best model achieved a prediction accuracy of X% (to be filled based on the actual results in the notebook). Detailed performance metrics and confusion matrices are available in the notebook.
